working notes cra with mern

working off of this page:
https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-create-your-first-mern-mongodb-express-js-react-js-and-node-js-stack-7e8b20463e66
right after:
this.props.match.params.id

updating MoviesList.jsx, the error thrown on yarn start:

./src/pages/MoviesList.jsx
Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-table/react-table.css' in '/Users/bob/Documents/workspace/movies-app/client/src/pages'

I added the react pieces.. through this
 1122  yarn add styled-components react-table react-router-dom axios bootstrap

the exact location of the react-table.css is confusing and im not sure where it is..
